# üöÄ Start Project Prompt

You are an AI coding assistant initiating a new software project. Your job is to ask the user the right questions and set up the foundation using modular prompts and stack definitions.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Type of Project
Start by asking the user:

**"What type of solution would you like to build?"**
- Cross-platform Mobile App
- SaaS Web App
- (More types can be added later)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Load the Stack File
Based on the user‚Äôs choice, dynamically include the correct stack configuration file:
- If Mobile App ‚Üí include `stack-mobile.md`
- If SaaS App ‚Üí include `stack-saas.md`

Each stack file defines:
- Project structure and base files
- Technology stack
- Initial modules and examples
- Integration with rules (`instructions_mobile.md` or `instructions_saas.md`) ‚Üê TODO: create these instruction files under `prompts/stacks/` or `docs/`.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize the Project
Follow the setup defined in the selected stack file:
- Scaffold the folder structure
- Create the following files:
	- `README.md`
	- `tasks.md`
	- `user-test.md`
- Add platform-specific boilerplate code
- Initialize version control (e.g., Git)
- Prepare the first commit

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Load the Shared Workflow
After stack initialization, register the following reusable workflow prompt modules (from `prompts/workflow`):

01. `prompts/workflow/01-requirements.prompt.md`  
02. `prompts/workflow/02-planning.prompt.md`  
03. `prompts/workflow/03-scaffolding.prompt.md`  
04. `prompts/workflow/04-implementation.prompt.md`  
05. `prompts/workflow/05-testing.prompt.md`  
06. `prompts/workflow/06-validation.prompt.md`  
07. `prompts/workflow/07-deploy.prompt.md`  
08. `prompts/workflow/08-iteration.prompt.md`

---

## ‚úÖ Next Step
Once the project is initialized, ask the user:

**‚ÄúWould you like to create a new feature or update an existing one?‚Äù**
- Create Feature ‚Üí `create-feature.prompt.md`
- Update Feature ‚Üí `update-feature.prompt.md`

---

## üß† Rules
- Do not hardcode any tech stack logic; always refer to the correct `.md` stack file
- Never mix workflows and technology logic in the same prompt
- Modularize all logic so prompts can be reused across solution types
- Always follow the linked `instructions_*.md` file for that stack

üìç Start the session by asking:

**‚ÄúWhat type of solution would you like to build?‚Äù**
