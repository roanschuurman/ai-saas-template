```

## Backlog Management

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Review high-priority items during iteration planning
- **Monthly**: Prioritize medium-priority items
- **Quarterly**: Assess low-priority items and research topics

### Prioritization Criteria
1. **Business Value**: Impact on user experience and business goals
2. **Technical Risk**: Complexity and potential for technical debt
3. **Dependencies**: Blocking other work or blocked by other work
4. **Effort Estimation**: Time and resources required
5. **Strategic Alignment**: Alignment with product roadmap

### Moving Items to Active Development
Items are promoted from backlog to active development during the Iteration step (08) when:
- Current iteration goals are met
- Item aligns with strategic priorities
- Required dependencies are resolved
- Team capacity is available
- Business value justifies the effort

---

*This backlog is updated during each Iteration step (08) and reviewed regularly to ensure it reflects current priorities and emerging needs.*
